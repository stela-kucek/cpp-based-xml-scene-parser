This file contains a few remarks specific to the program for Lab4b.

Programming language and version: C++ 11

Tested with following machines&compilers:
- on Windows: g++ 7.3.0
- on Linux Ubuntu: g++ 7.3.0

Libraries used: 
- standard library
- pugixml (https://pugixml.org/) for loading the scene files
- OBJLoader for loading meshes from obj files
- cmath --> only for using the Pi constant (M_PI) and the square root function (sqrt())

For modularity, the program is composed of the following files according to functionality:
	- main.cpp (main file, entry point)
	- vec3.h
	- xml_reader.h
	- obj_reader.h
	- camera.h
	- light.h
	- ray.h
	- surface.h
	- sphere.h
	- triangle.h
	
	# output
		--> this folder will contain the generated image file(s) 
			(after successful compilation and running of the application; initially, this folder is empty.)
			--> see "How to compile and run" below
	# OBJ-loader
		--> this folder contains OBJLoader library files
	# pugi_xml
		--> this folder contains pugixml library files
	# scenes
		--> this folder contains XML scene files

	* Makefile
		--> this file compiles the relevant resources and generates a "lab4b" executable 

(!) Please note that only the first 4 required tasks are implemented.
	texture mapping is not implemented! --> example4.xml open_room is initialized with solid color

How to compile and run: 
1. open a terminal in the project folder (i.e. where the Makefile is)
2. run the "make" command
3. run "./lab4b <XML_FILE_PATH>" to start the program with the desired xml file
	(e.g. "./lab4b scenes/example3.xml")
4. open the "output" folder to see the generated image file(s)
